module.exports = 'DEMO_KEY';

/*
In order to use this application, regardless of your authentication credential, you MUST enable API
  authentication.

You MUST change the name of this file from:

'EDIT-THIS-FILE-authentication.js' to 'authentication.js'

The above 'DEMO_KEY' is a valid, free authentication credential to access the NASA.data API.
  However, there are time-sensitive query limits restricting how often you may access
  the API. If you would like to apply for your own, unique NASA.data API credential,
  it is still free. And, the query limits are much less restrictive.

You can apply for your own API key at: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html

To enable your own authentication key, replace 'DEMO_KEY' in the export statement above
  with your own key. Make sure that you're exporting a string value.

DEMO_KEY rate limits:
- Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
- Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day

Web service rate liimits:
- Hourly Limit: 1,000 requests per hour

NOTE: The file name 'authentication.js' is already included in this repo's .gitignore file.
  So, simply changing the file name BEFORE inserting your API key will prevent unintentional
  credential vulnerabilities.

  But, make sure that you know what you're doing. And, if you choose to apply for your
  own API authentication key, double-check that you are properly ignoring the file.

  Do not publish your authentication credentials to GitHub or anywhere else on the internet.
