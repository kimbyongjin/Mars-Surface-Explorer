# Mars Surface Explorer

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## Description

Mars Surface Explorer provides a portal through which a user can access the photographic images of three Mars Rover programs: Curiosity, Discovery, and Spirit.

Select a rover, camera, and Martian date then click the "Explore Mars" button.

## Instructions to run locally:

- IMPORTANT: To run this application, you must enable API authentication. To do so, closely follow the instructions in the file ```EDIT-THIS-FILE-authentication.js```

- You will have to change the file name to ```authentication.js```. Applying for your own unique API key is optional and free. But, feel free to test out the application with the supplied ```'DEMO_KEY'```. Just take note of the demo rate limits.

- ALWAYS ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT COMPROMISE YOUR ONLINE CREDENTIALS. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY IGNORE FILES, LOOK IT UP.

- You will need an installation of Node.js on your machine. You can check out [this cool blog](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/) or the [official Node.js site](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) build.

- After installing node, make sure to restart terminal.

- Starting with a new terminal window in this repo's root directory, run the following scripts~

- To install dependencies:
```npm install```

- To run webpack and transpile the React.js production bundle:
```npm run build-prod```

- To start the production express server:
```npm start```

- The express server is now runnng on your localhost at port 3000. So, With the server running, open a browser window and navigate to ```localhost:3000```

- Now, you can Explore Mars!
