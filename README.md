# Mars Surface Explorer

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## Description

Mars Surface Explorer provides a portal through which a user can access the photographic images of three Mars Rover programs: Curiosity, Discovery, and Spirit.

Select a rover, camera, and Martian date then click the "Explore Mars" button.

## Instructions to run locally:

>You will need an installation of Node.js on your machine. You can check out (this cool blog)[https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/] or the (official Node.js site)[https://nodejs.org/en/] to install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) build.

>Start with a new terminal window in the root directory, run the following scripts:

To install dependencies:
```npm install```

To run webpack and transpile the React.js production bundle:
```npm run build-prod```

To start the production express server:
```npm start```

The express server is now runnng on your localhost at port 3000. So, With the server running, open a browser window and navigate to ```localhost:3000```

Now, you can Explore Mars!
