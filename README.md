# Mars Surface Explorer

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## Description

Mars Surface Explorer provides a portal through which a user can access the photographic images of three Mars Rover programs: Curiosity, Discovery, and Spirit.

Select a rover, camera, and Martian date then click the "Explore Mars" button.
